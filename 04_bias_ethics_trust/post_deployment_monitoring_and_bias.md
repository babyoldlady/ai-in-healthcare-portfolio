# Post-Deployment Monitoring, Bias, and the Question of “Tolerable Risk”

## The Core Problem

Bias does not disappear at FDA clearance.  

AI systems deployed in healthcare operate within dynamic clinical environments, where:

- Patient populations shift  
- Documentation practices evolve  
- Disease prevalence changes  
- Clinical guidelines update  

This phenomenon, often referred to as dataset shift, can degrade model performance over time (Finlayson et al., 2021).

## Evidence from Real-World Deployment

Liou et al. (2024) demonstrated that a deployed malnutrition prediction model required recalibration after implementation due to:

- Miscalibration  
- Unequal subgroup performance  
- Changing risk distributions  

Even models with acceptable discrimination can exhibit inequitable performance across race, sex, or other demographic groups.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now promotes a total product lifecycle approach for AI-enabled medical devices, including post-deployment monitoring and pre-specified update plans (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2025).

## The Governance Question

A persistent ethical question remains:

Who decides what constitutes an acceptable or “tolerable” level of bias in patient care?

Potential stakeholders include:

- Regulatory agencies  
- Institutional review boards  
- Health system governance committees  
- Multidisciplinary oversight panels  

Bias mitigation through monitoring and recalibration is necessary — but not sufficient without clear accountability structures.

## Personal Lens: Dementia and Menopause-Stage Care

In dementia and menopause-stage care:

- Symptoms often emerge gradually  
- Patients rely heavily on self-report  
- Documentation may be incomplete or inconsistent  
- Historical underdiagnosis already exists  

Unchecked bias in these domains may compound diagnostic delay rather than reduce it.

Monitoring and recalibration are not technical luxuries; they are ethical obligations.

## Governance Insight

AI in healthcare requires:

- Continuous performance auditing  
- Transparent recalibration processes  
- Defined accountability structures  
- Clinician oversight  

Bias mitigation must be both statistical and institutional.
