# Reflection: Medical Terminology as an AI-in-Healthcare Skill

Before this coursework, medical terminology appeared to be a supporting detail rather than a foundational component of healthcare AI. Through studying AI-enabled applications in cognitive care, women’s health, and clinical decision support, it became clear that terminology directly shapes how patient data are labeled, interpreted, and acted upon by algorithms.

This work highlighted how conditions such as perimenopause and subjective cognitive decline challenge traditional data structures. These clinical states are often underdocumented, inconsistently coded, or captured only through patient-reported experiences, making them difficult for AI systems to detect reliably. This reinforced the idea that AI limitations are frequently data and language problems rather than purely modeling failures.

The most significant insight from this module is that responsible healthcare AI begins upstream, with precise clinical language, thoughtful data stewardship, and awareness of whose experiences are captured or excluded. Developing AI systems that clinicians and patients can trust requires equal attention to technical rigor, clinical context, and ethical responsibility.
