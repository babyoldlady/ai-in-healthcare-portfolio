# Explaining AI Limitations to Clinical Leaders

In healthcare, AI systems are often expected to deliver clear, objective answers. In practice, their outputs are shaped by data completeness, clinical documentation habits, and the language used to define medical conditions.

For example, conditions such as perimenopause or subjective cognitive decline are not binary diagnoses and are often documented inconsistently. When these terms are poorly defined in data, AI systems may fail to identify at-risk patients or may produce misleading predictions.

Effective AI deployment requires clinicians and administrators to understand that model limitations often reflect data and documentation realities rather than technical shortcomings. Transparent communication about these constraints is essential to building trust and ensuring safe clinical use.
