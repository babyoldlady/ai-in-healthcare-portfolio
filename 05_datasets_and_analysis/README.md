# Datasets and Analysis

This folder contains exploratory analysis and reflections on healthcare datasets used in AI-related coursework. The focus is on understanding healthcare data structure, basic statistical insights, data quality limitations, and the implications these factors have for AI and machine learning in clinical settings.

Rather than emphasizing model development, this section highlights responsible data interpretation, clinical context, and the risks of over-reliance on imperfect real-world data.
