# Medical Terminology in AI-Driven Healthcare

## Purpose
Artificial intelligence in healthcare operates at the intersection of **clinical language and computational systems**. This folder highlights selected medical terms (“termini technici”) frequently encountered in AI-driven healthcare research and applications, explaining their clinical meaning, contextual use, and importance for safe and effective AI development.

Mastery of medical terminology is essential for:
- Interpreting healthcare datasets correctly
- Designing clinically meaningful AI models
- Communicating effectively with clinicians and stakeholders
- Avoiding misrepresentation of patient conditions in AI systems

## Medical Terminology & AI Foundations

This folder demonstrates how precise medical terminology underpins safe and effective
AI deployment in healthcare. The included paper analyzes key clinical terms related to
cognitive decline, women’s health, and data infrastructure, illustrating how language
choices directly affect data quality, model performance, and patient safety.

Skills demonstrated:
- Medical terminology literacy
- Clinical context awareness
- AI data labeling implications
- Technical writing for healthcare audiences

## Key Takeaway
AI systems in healthcare depend on **precise medical terminology** to translate complex physiological and clinical concepts into reliable computational models. Misunderstanding or misusing medical language can propagate errors, bias, and unsafe recommendations. Developing fluency in both medical and AI terminology is foundational to responsible, patient-centered healthcare AI.
