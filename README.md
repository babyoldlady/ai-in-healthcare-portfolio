# AI in Healthcare Portfolio

This repository showcases selected coursework, applied analysis, and written reflections from my studies in **Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**. It is designed to demonstrate my ability to understand, evaluate, and communicate how AI systems interact with real-world healthcare environments — clinically, ethically, and operationally.

Rather than focusing solely on model development, this portfolio emphasizes **data quality, clinical context, decision support, bias mitigation, and trust**, which are critical to deploying safe, effective, and responsible AI in healthcare settings.

## Areas of Focus

### 1. Medical Terminology & AI Literacy
Exploration of essential medical terminology (“termini technici”) commonly encountered in AI-driven healthcare research, with emphasis on:
- Clinical meaning and context  
- Why precise terminology matters for AI training and interpretation  
- Bridging communication between clinicians, data scientists, and stakeholders

### 2. Healthcare Data Quality & Interoperability
Analysis of how healthcare data characteristics affect AI performance, including:
- Missingness, inconsistency, and documentation gaps  
- Claims vs. EHR data and reimbursement-driven bias  
- Coding standards (e.g., ICD-10, CPT)  
- Interoperability challenges across legacy systems  

Grounded in recent peer-reviewed literature and real-world examples.

### 3. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)
Overview of how AI-enhanced CDSS support (but do not replace) clinical decision-making, including:
- Risk stratification and diagnostic support  
- Human-in-the-loop design principles  
- Ethical responsibility and clinician accountability  
- Workflow integration considerations

### 4. Bias, Ethics, and Trust in Healthcare AI
Critical examination of:
- Label noise and bias in real-world healthcare datasets  
- Equity risks when using administrative and claims data  
- Transparency, explainability, and patient trust  
- Governance strategies for responsible AI deployment

### 5. Healthcare Datasets & Basic Analysis
Hands-on work with mock healthcare datasets to demonstrate:
- Data interpretation and descriptive statistics  
- Awareness of sample size limitations  
- Responsible framing of analytic results

### 6. Writing & Reflections
Selected written work adapted from discussion posts and assignments, demonstrating:
- Ability to synthesize technical and clinical concepts  
- Clear, professional communication for diverse audiences  
- Evidence-based reasoning supported by peer-reviewed and .gov sources

## Intended Audience

This portfolio is intended for:
- HR recruiters and hiring managers
- Healthcare AI, digital health, and clinical informatics teams
- Organizations focused on responsible, patient-centered AI

It reflects my interest in roles that sit at the intersection of **healthcare, data, ethics, and communication**, including healthcare AI analysis, clinical informatics, AI governance, and digital health strategy.
